/**
 * This file contains an algorithm that accumulates the times with
 * voice to amortage the time we wait for more voice.
 *
 * The idea is that we have an accumulator that will say how much
 * time this will wait for more voice to come. It increases each
 * time there is voice and decreases when not. 
 *
 * TODO: Maybe with an array use several sections to increment
 * differently the tolerance instead of only 2. Also, decimal
 * values could help.
